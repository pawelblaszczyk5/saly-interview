# Used technologies

## SvelteKit

It's a modern meta-framework for building full-stack apps with Svelte. I choose it because it allows us to create the backend part too. Moreover, it's lightweight and fast, developer and user experience are both excellently on par. It provides excellent SEO too.

## PostCSS

It's a modern, extensible tool for transforming CSS with JS. With a rich plugin ecosystem, it allows usage of CSS the way you like. Moreover, it provides necessary tools for minifying and prefixing stylesheets.
